                            Daily Manager

                            The application should use Rails 4+ framework.

                            This application should control the register of daily scrum meetings. I know this is not supposed to exist, but it's for test purposes only.

                            This system should have users and teams.
                            Each team should have a leader that's also a team member.

                            Every day, the team members should create their yesterday's completed tasks, today's tasks and a list of impediments.

                            The team leader should be able to check the team lists and see everything that was done yesterday, what should be done today and all the impediments.

                            You should push your code to github and the repository link must be sent to the interviewer.

                            Bonus tasks:
                            The team leader may be responsible for more than one team.
                            The users may be in more than one team.
